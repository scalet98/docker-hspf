One of the columns in the file specified above must contain the data-set

_HELP
Enter the data-set number on which you wish to add the attributes from
the flat file.  The default provided is the first available data set
on the WDM file.  Data-set numbers may be changed within the flat file
(a record containing 'DSN 22' would set the current data set to 22).

If you want to add attributes to a new data set, enter the number of
that data set in the previous field and enter NEW in this field.
If you want to add attributes to an existing data set, enter the number of
that data set in the previous field and enter OLD in this field.
$FIELD @YON

_HELP
Enter the format of the attributes to be entered.
Use V to specify field width and precision of attribute values (e.g. V9.1).
Use X to skip any number of spaces on a record (e.g. 5X).
Use F to define field separators followed by either the actual field
separator character or the ASCII number (9 for tab) for that character.
If a field is followed by a separator, the field length is not required.
Example: PREC   1900    6   1
  use:V,F9,V,F9,V,F9,V  (if Tab used for separators)
  use:V5,V7,V5,V4       (if fixed field format)
Repetition is done by preceeding the field definition with a number.
Examples:  6V8.1    6(V,F9)    (V8.1)--> repeats till end of record
