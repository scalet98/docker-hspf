SeqVrsn    $(SeqGli)             The parm__.seq file defines parameters that
                                 are specific to the the platform and the GKS
                                 library being used:
                                   gli - Unix & GliGKS version
                                  xgks - Unix & Xgks
                                   dg - Data General Unix with Prior GKS
                                   pc - pc version with Lahey & Interacter
                                 See doc/config.txt for more details on using
                                 the optimal values and on customizing this
                                 file.
ObjVrsn    $(ObjUnix)            There are a few code groups that may be system
           $(ObjSun)             specific.  With the exception of the util
                                 makefile,  assumes generic Unix.  util uses
                                 calls to system date and time routines; a
                                 Fortran 90 version is provided as well as
                                 several platform-specific Fortran 77 versions.
                                 See below for a description of the variations.
WDNAME     /usr/opt/wrdapp       Path name of directory containing the
               /libanne4.0/...   required message file, immediately followed
                                 by the directory name and file name.
                                 This is usually the last line in the file.
RECL       2048 bytes            The units used for the record length in an
                                 open statement for a binary direct access
                                 file vary between operating systems, and even
                                 between compilers on the same operating system.
                                 The record length of a WDM file is 512 words,
                                 adjust RECL as appropriate for the compiler.
                                 512 words = 1024 half words = 2048 bytes.
SymTbl     $(BSD)                System V library archive automatically
                                 builds a symbol table.  When BSD is used,
                                 the symbol table must be explicitly built,
                                 set SymTbl to $(BSD).
ArOpt      rv                    Library archive options.
FFLAGS     $(OptM) $(FFVrsn)     Fortran compiler flags
                                 NOTE:  The names of the C functions in the
                                        library code end in an underscore, but
                                        the underscore is omitted when the
                                        functions are invoked.  You may need
                                        to include a linker option in FFLAGS
                                        which will cause compiler-generated
                                        external names to be postfixed with an
                                        underscore.
                                 NOTE:  Compile options may need to be changed
                                        if you change compilers (FC).  Current
                                        options are for Sun Solaris f77.
FC         f77                   Fortran compiler name
FFVrsn     $(FFUnix)             Target operating system.  Specifies any
                                 platform and (or) compiler specific
                                 compile options; assumes generic Unix.
                                 FFAIX provided.  Use FFSun, FFDG, FFDec,
                                 FFLinux, or FFHP to add specific options.
CFLAGS     $(OptC)               C compiler flags.
CC         gcc                   C compiler name.
LdA        $(LdSunA)             Load options combined with LdB.  Use LdUnixA
                                 for system defaults.  LdSunA will create a
                                 static executable on the Sun.
LdB        $(LdSunB)             Load options combined with LdA.  Use LdUnixB
                                 for system defaults.  LdSunB will create a
                                 static executable on the Sun.
SHELL      /bin/sh               The make file(s) contain commands for the
                                 Bourne shell, sh.  This will override
                                 implementations of make that use the
                                 SHELL environment variable.  If this is
                                 changed, additional changes will probably
                                 have to be made in the make file(s).
shCmd      sh                    The shell command is sh.  If SHELL is
                                 changed, this may need to be modified.
Vers       gli                   Usually passed from src/Makefile,
                                 the parm__.seq file defines the parameters
                                 that are specific to the platform and the
                                 GKS library being used:
                                   gli - Unix & GliGKS version
                                  xgks - Unix & Xgks
                                   dg - Data General Unix with Prior GKS
                                   pc - pc version with Interacter
                                 See doc/config.txt for details.
