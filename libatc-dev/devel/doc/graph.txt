NAME
     graph - Interface to Graphical Kernel System (GKS)

ABSTRACT
     The GRAPH library contains a set of routines that have been
     used to generate a range of plots in hydrologic
     applications.  Graphics include time plots at scales of
     minutes to years, x-y plots, and probability plots.  Non-
     time axes can be arithmetic, logarithmic, or probability.
     Probability plots with Gaussian transformations can be
     fraction, percent, or recurrence interval.  The library was
     developed using the Graphical Kernel System (GKS) standard
     to provide portability.  The GRAPH library is used by ANNIE,
     GLSNET, HSPEXP, HYSEP, PEAKFQ, SWSTAT, and other programs.

     The GRAPH library is included in the LIBANNE distribution.
     It requires the UTIL and STATS libraries from the LIBANNE
     distribution.

HISTORY
     Version 4.0 2002/02/25 - The name of the lib library
        distribution changed to libanne.  See libanne
        documentation for details.

     Version 3.1 1996/12/11 - Updates

     Version 3.0 1996/03/01 - Include file names changed to lower
        case.

     Version 2.1 1994/08/11 - Updates

     Version 2.0 1994/05/27 - General release

     Version 1.0 1992 - General release, ported to UNIX platform.

     NOTE: Version numbers and dates are for the entire LIBANNE
           set of libraries.  A new version does not necessarily
           indicate that all of the libraries have changed.

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
     GRAPH is written in Fortran 77 with the following extension:
     use of include files. The GRAPH library requires STATS and
     UTIL libraries.

DOCUMENTATION
     A subroutine reference guide is provided in the
     distribution.

SUPPORTING SOFTWARE
     The  GRAPH library is written using the GKS standard.  A set
     of routines that translates GKS calls to Interactive
     Software Service's INTERACTER calls is included.  An
